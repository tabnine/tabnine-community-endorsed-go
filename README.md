# tabnine-community-endorsed-go
Please feel free to submit a PR to add high quality Go repos, to help us build and train a custom Go model for the community.
## How can you help out ?
You can look at the repos.csv file, which already has some Rust repos in it. 

Please add your own csv (based on template.csv) to this repo with your suggested public Go repos so we can train on them and improve the model for you guys! Make sure to give the file an indicative name (your username is a great convention).

Thanks for your help!
